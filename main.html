            <h2>My Career Objective</h2>
            <p>With a stellar academic record from 10th to B.Tech, achieving an impressive overall
               CGPA of 8.0, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to excellence. I possess
                a dynamic mindset, believing in my ability to adapt seamlessly to any MNC environmen
                t and learn rapidly, showcasing a strong work ethic. </p>
                <p> While pursuing my undergraduate degree at a prestigious institution,
                   I aspired to further my education with an MS in the USA. Achieving
                   a commendable GRE score of 327 and a Duolingo score of 125, I secured
                    admission but faced financial constraints. Undeterred, I pivoted
                     towards gaining practical experience and enrolled in a 6-month
                      intensive programming course, honing my skills to perfection.
                    </p>
                    <p> Now, well-versed in various programming languages, I am eager
                       to contribute my expertise to top-tier MNCs. I am seeking a role
                        that not only tests my capabilities but also provides an environment
                         where I can learn and grow. My long-term goal is to make a
                         significant impact within leading MNCs.
